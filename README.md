Vision statement:

Our app, Gemma, will help people navigate the natural world. Like Google Maps, Gemma locates users and lets them save specific locations. 
Unlike Google Maps, though, it focuses on "trail territory”—fields, forests, and other open spaces that aren’t marked by roads. Users can 
save their current location or other coordinates as “pins,” along with notes and pictures as desired. (Gemma also displays as many pins 
as a user can drop, something Google Maps does not do.) 

Although Evernote’s Atlas feature offers a similar functionality, Atlas records only the user’s location when the note was made, rather 
than other locations for later trips. Evernote also doesn’t let users make “pins” public... but Gemma does. Users can choose to see public 
pins (the area’s most popular/upvoted locations) or their own private ones. With Gemma, you can save trailheads, kayak launches, picnic 
spots, unofficial skate parks... the possibilities are as endless as your exploring. Where will you go with Gemma?
