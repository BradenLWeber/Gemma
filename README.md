------ Vision statement ------

Today, navigation is easier than ever before. Apps like Google and Apple Maps locate users, find destinations, and plot routes in a flash. They can even “drop pins” to save locations for later visits. But there’s one catch: all these places must be on (or near) the beaten path. GPS apps know streets and buildings just fine. When it comes to the outdoors, though—places to hike, kayak, picnic, or just sit and birdwatch—these concrete-focused apps come up empty.  

That’s why we’re building Gemma. Gemma is a geolocator app designed for “trail territory”: natural spaces that aren’t marked by roads. Users can save their current location, or other coordinates, as “pins.” They can also add notes and pictures to pins as they desire. Gemma allows users to toggle between public pins (the area’s most popular/upvoted locations) or their own private ones. With Gemma as a resource, young digital natives are empowered to join the outdoor adventure. Scenic walks, bike paths, unofficial skate parks... the possibilities are as endless as your exploring. Where will you go with Gemma?

***Oscar***
- Bio: Driven by passion, and danger. Physics and CS double major, but mostly a complete dork. I will do whatever is necessary to reach my goals, even lift a car (did that one time). The problem is that my goals don't always align with what's actually important; for example: spending a semester developing electromyography circuits for muscle-to-servo control, while I really should have been in class (it WAS pretty sweet tho).
